In this case, the original count would end, and a new count would begin for the newly Held Robot.\nIn the case of Trapping, if an avenue of escape becomes available due to changing circumstances in the Match.\nAfter a Holding count ends, a Robot may not resume Holding the same Robot again for another 5-count. If a Team resumes Holding the same Robot within that 5-count, the original count will resume from where it ended.",

Once the Match begins, Robots may only expand beyond their starting size and configuration within the following criteria:\nRobots may never exceed an overall footprint of 24” x 18”. For reference, 24” is roughly the width of one foam field tile.\nFrom the Robot’s perspective, only one “X/Y” direction may expand outside of the starting configuration during the Match (i.e., the Robot can’t get both wider and longer). This single expansion direction must be identified and measured during Robot inspection, as shown in the figures below.\nVertical expansion is addressed separately by rule <SG3>. Robots may expand both horizontally and vertically; the top of the Robot is not considered an “X/Y” direction in the context of this rule.\nNote: Horizontal expansion is measured from the Robot’s perspective; i.e., it does “rotate with the Robot.” Robots that tip over, or rotate while Climbing, are still restricted to expanding “from the one side” in the chosen direction that was measured during inspection.\nThe intent of this rule is to limit horizontal expansion in a way that can be easily interpreted by Head Referees during a Match and assessed by Robot inspectors. For example, a Robot can expand a mechanism in a single direction up to a 24” maximum size, but cannot expand a Mobile Goal manipulator from one side and a Ring manipulator from another (unless one of those is already identified and extended as part of the Robot’s inspected starting configuration). The figures below do not not provide an exhaustive list of all possible Robot configurations and expansions, and should serve as examples to provide some clarity about the intent of this rule.",

For the purposes of this rule, “on a Stake” means that the Ring meets the criteria for a Scored Ring, even if it is being contacted by a Robot.\nPlowing multiple Mobile Goals is permitted. However, Plowing an additional Mobile Goal while also Possessing one is considered a Violation of this rule due to the extremely high likelihood of accidental/implied Possession. Teams which employ Plowing strategies are encouraged to clearly demonstrate that none of the Mobile Goals are being Possessed, e.g., by using a flat face of the Robot with no active mechanisms.\nViolation Notes: Any egregious or clearly intentional Violation by an Alliance who wins the Match will be considered a Major Violation. Examples of “clearly intentional” Violations include, but are not limited to:\nPossessing two or more Mobile Goals in a single Corner.\nContinuing to play other portions of the game (e.g., defensive maneuvers, Climbing) without returning to a starting position for the majority of the Match.\n“Accidentally” Possessing an egregious amount of opponent Rings.\nPossessing six Rings, and Scoring them onto one Stake with a single action.\n“Removing excess Scoring Objects” directly into Placed/Scored states.\nSignificant Q&As:\n2011 - Any Ring(s) removed from a Stake can count toward Possession\n2013 - Guarding a Mobile Goal isn’t the same as Possessing (or Plowing) it\n2026 - Possession is not transitive through other Robots",

This especially pertains to modular or swappable mechanisms (per <R1>) and Match starting configurations/sizes (per <R4>).\nTeams may be requested to submit to spot inspections by Head Referees. Refusal to submit will result in Disqualification. If a Robot is determined to be in Violation of a Robot rule before a Match begins, the Robot will be removed from the Field.

          "fullText": "Officially registered Team numbers must be displayed on Robot license plates. To participate in an official VEX V5 Robotics Competition event, a Team must first register on robotevents.com and receive a V5RC Team number. This Team number must be displayed on the Robot using license plates. Teams may choose to use the official V5RC License Plate Kit, or may create their own.\nLicense plates must be placed on a minimum of two (2) horizontally opposing sides of the Robot (i.e., the top of a Robot is not considered a “side”), and must remain visible and attached for the entirety of the Match.\nRobots must use plates that match their Alliance color for each Match (i.e., red Alliance Robots must have their red plates on for the Match). It must be abundantly clear which color Alliance the Robot belongs to. If both colors of license plates are mounted on a Robot, then the incorrect color must be covered, taped over, or otherwise obscured. Since license plates are considered non-functional decorations, this is a legal non-functional use of tape.\nLicense plates are considered non-functional decorations (per <R9>), and must fulfill all relevant Robot rules (e.g., they must fit within the 18” cube, cannot functionally change the stability or rigidity of the Robot, cause Entanglement, etc.).\nTeam numbers must be in white font, and clearly legible.\nLicense plates must be at least 2.48 inches (63 mm) tall and 4.48 inches (114 mm) wide, i.e., at least the height/width dimensions of the plates in the V5RC License Plate Kit.\nThe intent of this rule is to make it immediately apparent to Head Referees which Alliance and which Team each Robot belongs to, at all times. The ‘wrong’ color doesn’t have to be 100% obscured, but being able to “see through” a Robot arm to the wrong color license plate on the opposite side of the Robot could cause confusion, and would be considered a Violation of <R10a>. It will be at the full discretion of the Head Referee and inspector at a given event to determine whether a given custom license plate satisfies the criteria listed in <R10>. Teams wishing to utilize custom plates should be prepared for the possibility of this judgment, and ensure that they are prepared to replace any custom parts with official VEX license plates if requested. Not bringing official replacement plates to an event will not be an acceptable reason for overlooking a violation of one or more points in <R10>.

To participate in an official VEX V5 Robotics Competition event, a Team must first register on robotevents.com and receive a V5RC Team number. This Team number must be displayed on the Robot using license plates. Teams may choose to use the official V5RC License Plate Kit, or may create their own.\nLicense plates must be placed on a minimum of two (2) horizontally opposing sides of the Robot (i.e., the top of a Robot is not considered a “side”), and must remain visible and attached for the entirety of the Match.\nRobots must use plates that match their Alliance color for each Match (i.e., red Alliance Robots must have their red plates on for the Match). It must be abundantly clear which color Alliance the Robot belongs to. If both colors of license plates are mounted on a Robot, then the incorrect color must be covered, taped over, or otherwise obscured. Since license plates are considered non-functional decorations, this is a legal non-functional use of tape.\nLicense plates are considered non-functional decorations (per <R9>), and must fulfill all relevant Robot rules (e.g., they must fit within the 18” cube, cannot functionally change the stability or rigidity of the Robot, cause Entanglement, etc.).\nTeam numbers must be in white font, and clearly legible.\nLicense plates must be at least 2.48 inches (63 mm) tall and 4.48 inches (114 mm) wide, i.e., at least the height/width dimensions of the plates in the V5RC License Plate Kit.\nThe intent of this rule is to make it immediately apparent to Head Referees which Alliance and which Team each Robot belongs to, at all times. The ‘wrong’ color doesn’t have to be 100% obscured, but being able to “see through” a Robot arm to the wrong color license plate on the opposite side of the Robot could cause confusion, and would be considered a Violation of <R10a>. It will be at the full discretion of the Head Referee and inspector at a given event to determine whether a given custom license plate satisfies the criteria listed in <R10>. Teams wishing to utilize custom plates should be prepared for the possibility of this judgment, and ensure that they are prepared to replace any custom parts with official VEX license plates if requested. Not bringing official replacement plates to an event will not be an acceptable reason for overlooking a violation of one or more points in <R10>. If a Robot must be removed from the Field based on this rule, <R3ci> applies and the Team should not be issued a “no-show.”\nFigure R10-1: : An example of a license plate made from the V5RC License Plate Kit.\nFigure R10-2: An example of a legal custom license plate.",

Examples include the 276-8340 PET sheets, and the 217-6626 / 217-6627 polycarbonate sheets.\nThis rule does not apply to 3D printed plastic parts. 3D printed parts are not permitted in the VEX V5 Robotics Competition, except as non-functional decorations (per <R9>) or as custom license plates (per <R10>).\nNote: The phrase “as cut from a single 12” x 24” sheet” is intended to mean that all individual plastic pieces must be able to theoretically “nest” or rearrange into a 12” x 24” area. The plastic pieces do not have to be cut from the same original 12” x 24” sheet. Teams are encouraged to “map” plastic use on a 12” x 24” sheet of paper for reference at tournament inspection.\nFigure R19-1: Custom plastic parts must fit within a single 12” x 24” sheet of plastic.",
